## Module 1

### Reflection 1

In implementing the Edit Product and Delete Product features for this Spring Boot application, I ensured that all variable and method names are self-explanatory. I structured my functions to perform only one task, ensuring they have no side effects. Instead of relying on unnecessary comments, I used clear function and variable names to improve code clarity, reducing the need for inline explanations.

From a secure coding perspective, I implemented null checks in findById to prevent potential NullPointerExceptions when accessing product properties. I also ensured that UUIDs are automatically assigned upon product creation, preventing duplicate or missing IDs.

One improvement I made was ensuring UUIDs are correctly handled in the repository instead of the controller. Initially, I didnâ€™t use UUIDs at all, but I later improved my code by generating UUIDs in the repository layer while keeping productId as a String. This made the controller cleaner, as it no longer needed to process or convert UUIDs.


### Reflection 2

Writing unit tests helped me verify the correctness and stability of the code, as it ensures that each function behaves as expected under different conditions, including positive scenarios, negative inputs, and edge cases. While code coverage helps measure how much of the source code is tested, achieving 100% coverage does not guarantee bug-free code, as logical errors and unforeseen scenarios can still exist.

When implementing additional functional test suites, I noticed a potential clean code issue. There were duplicated setup logic and instance variables across multiple test classes. This redundancy increases maintenance effort and makes refactoring more difficult. A better approach would be to extract common setup procedures into a base test class. This improves maintainability, reduces duplication, and enhances code scalability, ensuring a more structured and efficient testing framework.
